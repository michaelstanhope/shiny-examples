This repository contains the code for my [Student Loan Repayment Estimator app](https://michaelstanhope.shinyapps.io/shiny-examples/).

This calculator can be used to estimate the repayment period for a UK student loan. It is designed for UK nationals who started university in 2006.

## How to use this application

It's easy - just enter your loan amount, graduation year and assumptions on the left of the page. The text and chart in the results section will change accordingly.

## Definitions
* Initial Loan Amount: The loan amount at the time the student enters work (assumed to be September of their graduation year).
* Starting Salary: The student's salary when they start work.
* Annual Interest Rate: The interest rate applied to outstanding value of the loan by the SLC.
* Annual Salary Increase: A rough guess of the student's annual salary increase. Assume 4% if you don't know what to put here.
* Graduation Year: The year that the student finishes their studies and starts work. In the UK, most courses finish in the summer and graduates start work around September.
